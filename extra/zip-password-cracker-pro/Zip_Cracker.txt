Introduction :
--------------

ZIP Password Cracker Pro for Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 
2000, XP, etc.

This program is free software.  Anyone - any person, any company, 
or any business - can use this program for free.  No fees or 
payment is required.  See "Freeware Information" below.

ZIP Password Cracker Pro enables you to generate 
passwords and apply these to password protected
ZIP files.

This can be an incredibly useful thing to do when you
have backed up data to a ZIP file and mistyped or 
forgotten the password.  

This program saves Restart information as it tests 
passwords (every 10,000 passwords, or whenever the 
program is closed), so that if your computer crashes, 
or there is a power failure, or if you switch your 
computer off, then this program can continue where 
it left off next time you run it when you press 
the "Continue ZIP Testing" button.

This program currently supports ZIP files only - it will 
not work with RAR, ACE, or other compressed archive types.

Developed using 32-bit Delphi.

This program will **NOT** run under Windows 3.x  
(even with Win32 installed) !!


Why I wrote this program ?  What can it do ?
--------------------------------------------

In early 1998, I backed up loads of data to a ZIP file,
but when I went to restore some files from the backup
months later (in August 1998), I realised that I had 
mistyped my password and that my data was locked up 
tighter than a duck's arsehole.  ;)

I needed help to recover my password so that I could 
retrieve the files I needed.  So, as I usually do, I 
sat down and wrote this program.

I use very long passwords for all of my ZIP files - 15
characters or longer - and I use numbers, letters, and
other characters.

Now, the problem was that taking these characters and 
generating random passwords of this size would generate 
trillions of trillions of passwords.  Pretty soon I 
realised that it was going to take 1,000's of centuries 
on my poor old Pentium 100 to crack my ZIP file's 
password by Brute Force methods.

So, I realised that for my particular ZIP file, 
I needed something a lot better and a lot more focused 
than Brute Force methods.

So, then I added the "Password is Partly Known"
tab so that I could enter the characters I thought 
I had used in my ZIP file's password.  This
functionality then generated passwords by simulating
the hitting of keys around the keys used to type the
password I thought I had typed.

This resulted in far fewer passwords being generated 
and tested / trialed.

Then, I left my program running over night trying these
"Partly Known Passwords" against my password protected
ZIP file, and by morning it had worked out my mistyped 
password, and I could retrieve data from my ZIP file.

So, ZIP Password Cracker Pro will not be useful to
anyone wanting to crack any reasonably protected 
ZIP files.  e.g. where passwords are 10 characters
or more long.

But, this means that ZIP Password Cracker Pro
is still ideal for use in the following ways :

- use the "Password is Partly Known" functionality to
  crack short or long passwords when you have a reasonably 
  good idea what the password is.

or

- use "Brute Force Password Cracking" functionality 
  to crack shorter passwords when you have no idea what 
  the password is.


Benchmark Results :
--------------------

Below are some benchmark results :

- the number of passwords generated per second, and,

- the number of passwords tested against a small password 
  protected test ZIP file per second

for various computers that I have run Zip Cracker Pro on.

As time goes by, and I buy more powerful computers, or if people 
email me and let me know the benchmark results for their computers,
then I'll add more details to the above benchmark results.


Using this Program :
--------------------

To use this program, unzip the contents of the ZIP file to a 
directory - such as c:\zip_crack\ - and run the executable 
file : Zip_Cracker.EXE.

You then need to decide which method you want to use :

 - Brute Force Password Cracking
   This is most useful when you know nothing about the 
   password for the ZIP file.  Simply select uppercase
   letters, lowercase letters, numbers, etc and specify the
   length of passwords to generate, and then press the
   "Generate Passwords" passwords button.

 - Password is Partly Known
   This is most useful when you do know somethin about the 
   password for the ZIP file.  Simply type in the letters / 
   numbers / etc you think are in the required password,
   select the required options (Double hit each key, etc)
   and then press the "Generate Passwords" passwords button.

When the passwords are generated (according to your settings),
then the list of passwords will be displayed, and you will
be able to specify the ZIP file to test, and then test each 
password against the ZIP file.

In addition, you will see the estimated time to test 
all passwords in the list, which is based on your PC's
performance during previous ZIP file tests.

This program saves Restart information as it tests 
passwords, so that if your computer crashes, or there 
is a power failure, or you switch your computer off,
then this program will continue where it left off
next time you run it when you press the "Continue ZIP 
Testing" button.

This means that if your computer has been running for 
3 days testing 1,000's of passwords, and it crashes
or the power fails, then you do not need to start at 
the very beginning again.

I hope you find the program easy to use and useful.


Uninstalling this Program :
---------------------------

At the  present time, there is No Uninstall function.

If you ever want to delete ZIP Password Cracker Pro 
from your computer, then :

 1. Exit the program, and delete it from wherever you installed
    it on your harddrive.

Simple as that !


The Future :
------------

I've got tons of ideas for this program.

But, ofcourse, I will be very cautious in what features 
I add because I don't want to do anything to help any 
hackers / crackers out there gain access to any 
unauthorised data.  e.g. data inside password 
protected ZIP files.

Indeed, many ZIP files on my WEB site are protected - such 
as Talking Clock's speech packs - and only registered 
users get the passwords to access these files.  

So, I am very careful not to provide any functionality 
to allow internet based hackers / crackers to rip off 
any more of my work.  (These bastards do enough of this 
already !!)

In the future, many improvements could be made to this program,
such as :

- Better password generation methods.
  e.g. when you know the first part of the password is 
  "fred" and/or the last part of the password is "15".

- Support for other compressed archive types.  
  e.g. RAR, ACE, etc.  At the moment, this program only 
  supports ZIP files.

- Support for using pre-built lists of words, with the 
  ability to build these into extended lists - with 
  numeric prefixes, etc appended to each word in the list.

- Faster performance in generating passwords.
  (Especially when  you are generating many 10's of 
  1,000's of passwords).
  (See "Benchmark Results" above).

- Faster performance in checking passwords.
  (See "Benchmark Results" above).

- Display more statistics while the passwords are being 
  generated.  e.g. Password 337 / 80,000, estimated
  time until all passwords are generated, etc.

- Display more statistics while the passwords are being 
  tested against the ZIP file.  e.g. estimated
  time until all passwords are tested, etc.

- Anything else ?

If you would like any of these improvements, or would like to
suggest more, please email me and let me know.

How much more work I do on this program depends entirely on
what support I get, how many people use the program, how many
people have registered, etc.

Amendment History :
-------------------

Vers    Date        Description

1.0  22-May-2002    First Public Release.
                    (29,649 lines of code / comments.)

1.1  12-Nov-2002    Check file has an extension of 'ZIP' before proceeding 
                    with the testing.
                    Verify the ZIP file is a valid ZIP file before doing any 
                    sybsequent processing or testing.
                    Enormously speed up password generation and password 
                    testing for Registered Users of this program by :
                      1. Updating the stats every 100 passwords - not every 
                         password as this slow things down significantly.
                      2. Dynamically loading DLLs prior to processing.
                      3. Various other techniques and tricks.
                    Registered users can test passwords 5-20 times or
                    so faster than Un-Registered users (depends on PC).
                    Change the font to a scalable font for all items.
                    (Fix the autosize-text truncation).
                    Use colours to reflect the status of editboxes : 
                    grey = read only, white = user input, etc.
                    Add in support for the dragging and droping of ZIP 
                    file(s) from Windows Explorer.
                    Add "Benchmark Results" section to this text file.
                    Add buttons to enable the user to reset password list, 
                    and copy list to Windows clipoard, and paste password 
                    list from Windows clipoard.  (Registered Users only).
                    Add in the ability to continue password checking against
                    a ZIP file, if a correct password has already been found
                    but this password does not work on all files inside the 
                    ZIP file.  (Yes, some ZIP files are encrypted with 
                    multiple passwords).
                    Add in support for notification, testing, and advice
                    regarding unencrypted files (i.e. those with blank 
                    passwords).
                    Add in a pre-ZIP testing advice screen (with a 
                    "Do Not Show This Again" option).
                    Use a better initial default window size.
                    Various other use-ability enhancements.
                    (37,772 lines of code / comments.)

1.1b  20-Nov-2002   Bring the program up to date with my latest code libraries.
                    (43,009 lines of code / comments.)

1.2    4-Dec-2002   Add File Menu options to enable the user to create or delete 
                    shortcuts to this program on the Desktop, StartMenu, SendTo, etc
                    and you can do this *ANY* time - not just when the program is 
                    being installed.  (All Windows programs should provide this 
                    functionality).
                    You can now right-mouse click on a ZIP file and send it to
                    this program directly - provided there is a shortcut
                    to the program in the SendTo menu.  (See above).
                    Insert the characters around each key for some keys that
                    were missing these for the "Password is Partly Known"
                    password generations.  e.g. The keys around the "."  
                    key are ",<L;:'"/?".  (Thanks to Robert F for reporting 
                    this to me earlier today).
                    (55,759 lines of code / comments.)

1.2f  3-Sep-2007    This program is now FREEWARE - see "Freeware Information"
                    above.

1.2fb 13-Jan-2011   Update the DLL (UnzDll.dll) included with ZIP Password Cracker Pro.
                    Special thanks to Lost Identity for alerting me to the fact my 
                    program wasn't finding ZIP passwords properly.  It turned out it 
                    wasn't, because the DLL (UnzDll.dll) included with ZIP Password 
                    Cracker Pro was not the required version.


If this program was not downloaded from my Home Page, then
it is possibly an old version.  The latest version of this 
program is available from my WEB page - see below.
