***** Windows Software *****
****************************

Apple 2 Disk Drive Sound Simulator

	This does just what the title says - it simulates the 
	sound of Apple 2 disk drives by playing back sounds I 
	recorded of my Apple 2 disk drives in action. 
	Essential for all old Apple ][ fanatics ... ;) 


Astronaut's Chronometer
      
	This program calculates and displays the passage of time 
	on Earth and in the space ship, when the space ship is 
	going at close to the speed of light.


Backup Again

	Backup Again is a program that makes backing up your files
	a breeze.

	More specifically, Backup Again allows you to :
	- specify the directories to backup, 
	- specify whether you want to backup each directory or each 
	  directory and each of their sub-directories,
	- specify whether you want to backup all files, or just
	  those modified after a certain date,
	and then you simply press the "Backup and ZIP" button
	and all files are backed-up and compressed into a single 
	ZIP file which is automatically named according to the 
	current date / time.

	With Backup Again, backing up your data need never get 
	you down !!


Big Mouse Pointer

 	This program sits in the tray bar (with the clock, etc) and 
	enables you to use a BIG arrow (of just about any size and 
	colour) as the mouse pointer.


	Great for demonstrations, presentations, lectures, or people 
	who get sick of hunting for Microsoft's miniscule mouse pointer 
	on their lovely new 21 inch monitors ...  ;)


Binary Clock

	Binary Clock is a "for fun" program that displays a re-sizable
	binary clock - that is, a clock where the time is displayed 
	via the binary number system (base 2) instead of the 
	decimal number system (base 10).

	A whole range (in fact, some people would probably say 
	"a whole overkill") of settings, graphics, and options 
	are available via the settings menu.


Birthday and Event Reminder

	Birthday and Event Reminder allows you to easily keep track of 
	birthdays, anniversaries, school reunions, and other important 
	annual events.

	A range of functionality is provided with the program to help 
	you add, update, change, or delete events, and then report on 
	the events occuring within a specified number of days.  You 
	can copy and paste this report into emails or print it.
	You can also import the data from other date reminder progframs.

	This program should be very useful for helping you keep forwarned 
	of all important dates, so that you give yourself plenty of time 
	to organise and prepare for birthdays, anniversaries, and so on.
	Now, there is NO EXCUSE for forgetting or leaving things until 
	the last minute !!!


Calendar Year Simple

	Calendar Year Simple shows a very simple full year 
	calendar for whatever year you select - and that's 
	about it.

	The program calculates checksums for user-selected 
	files and directories, and enables the user to compare
	checksum results against previous calculations.  
	Also includes a great Command Line mode to enable 
	automatic periodic checking of files, with any 
	mismatches reported to the user.
	Checksums are very useful for making sure files have
	not been corrupted, changed, or tampered with.
	The included 32-bit version supports long file names,
	and enormous file lists.
      

Clean-Up Old Files

        Enables the user to specify one or more directories,
        and then periodically clean out / erase / delete files 
        that haven't been modified for a certain number of days.
        The program can run automatically at Windows start-up
        and also automatically exit after the clean-up.

	- Erase the data on the Window's Clipboard,
	- View the Text or Bitmap data in the Window's Clipboard,
	- List the formats of data currently available in the 
	  Window's Clipboard.

	This has various uses, but was primarily developed to enable 
	people to copy data from Windows or DOS console applications : 
	Windows sometimes does not clear its clipboard, and wont allow 
	you to copy any more data until you erase the clipboard's contents.  
	Clipboard Tools is ideal for clearing Windows clipboard for you.


Computer Space Simulator

	Computer Space Simulator is a remake / recreation of Computer Space, 
	which was the very first coin-operated video arcade game and went 
	on sale in 1971.

	The game play in Computer Space consists of you controlling a Rocket 
	and attacking and avoiding the computer controlled enemy Saucers 
	that are trying to shoot you or collide with you.  You have an 
	infinite number of lives, but each game has a set time limit.  
	The object of the game is to have a higher score than the enemy 
	at the end of the time limit.

	Demo, 1 Player Vs Saucers, Co-Op 2 Player Against the Saucers,
	and Player 1 Vs Player 2 (No Saucers) modes of play are supported.

Email Address Obscurifier

	This program can help you to obscure the email addresses 
	on your web page(s) so that they act the same and function the 
	same as before, but so that they cannot easily be accessed / 
	identified by email harvesting programs used by people 
	who send unsolicited junk email (SPAM) to 1,000's of 
	internet users.

	The result of this should be a reduction in the amount of
